  abstract = {This is the second edition of the now definitive text on partial differential equations (PDE). It offers a comprehensive survey of modern techniques in the theoretical study of PDE with particular emphasis on nonlinear equations. Its wide scope and clear exposition make it a great text for a graduate course in PDE. For this edition, the author has made numerous changes, including a new chapter on nonlinear wave equations, more than 80 new exercises, several new sections, a significantly expanded bibliography. About the First Edition: I have used this book for both regular PDE and topics courses. It has a wonderful combination of insight and technical detail. ... Evans' book is evidence of his mastering of the field and the clarity of presentation. --Luis Caffarelli, University of Texas It is fun to teach from Evans' book. It explains many of the essential ideas and techniques of partial differential equations ... Every graduate student in analysis should read it. --David Jerison, MIT I usePartial Differential Equationsto prepare my students for their Topic exam, which is a requirement before starting working on their dissertation. The book provides an excellent account of PDE's ... I am very happy with the preparation it provides my students. --Carlos Kenig, University of Chicago Evans' book has already attained the status of a classic. It is a clear choice for students just learning the subject, as well as for experts who wish to broaden their knowledge ... An outstanding reference for many aspects of the field. --Rafe Mazzeo, Stanford University},

  title = {Elasticity and Geometry: From hair curls to the non-linear response of shells},
  isbn = {978-0-19-882626-2},
  shorttitle = {Elasticity and Geometry},
  abstract = {We experience elasticity everywhere in daily life: in the straightening or curling of hairs, the irreversible deformations of car bodies after a crash, or the bouncing of elastic balls in ping-pong or soccer. The theory of elasticity is essential to the recent developments of applied and fundamental science, such as the bio-mechanics of {DNA} filaments and other macro-molecules, and the animation of virtual characters in computer graphics and materials science. In this book, the emphasis is on the elasticity of thin bodies (plates, shells, rods) in connection with geometry. It covers such topics as the mechanics of hairs (curled and straight), the buckling instabilities of stressed plates, including folds and conical points appearing at larger stresses, the geometric rigidity of elastic shells, and the delamination of thin compressed films. It applies general methods of classical analysis, including advanced nonlinear aspects (bifurcation theory, boundary layer analysis), to derive detailed, fully explicit solutions to specific problems. These theoretical concepts are discussed in connection with experiments. Mathematical prerequisites are vector analysis and differential equations. The book can serve as a concrete introduction to nonlinear methods in analysis.},

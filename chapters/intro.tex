\section{Introduction}

This is a set of collaborative math notes.
The topics are varied, and are chosen by contributors at their discretion, but all are methods in applied analysis.
Problems may come from physics, biology, computer science, engineering, or other disciplines, but the solutions are shown as mathematical proofs, stemming from ideas in analysis. \\

Further contributions are welcome and may be submitted either on the GitHub repository (available at \href{https://github.com/samueltwallace/AppliedAnalysis}{this website}), or by email to a contributor via \texttt{git send-email} or a similar command.
